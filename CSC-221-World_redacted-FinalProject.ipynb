    "\n",
    "## Reflection on Learning Progress\n",
    "\n",
    "I am more than happy with what I have learned and the mindset for coding that I have developed. This project tested every bit of my patience, but my determination was the overall winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I combined my basic knowledge of Python to develop a spoof. This spoof may just trick you into thinking the book you are buying is really something it isn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used a variety of different libraries and modules\n",
    "- Demonstrated the versatility of Python as a programming language\n",
    "- Learned new concepts and techniques along the way\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges Encountered\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the life of a developer!\n",
    "\n",
    "Some previously known methods weren't working as expected. This led to further learning and problem-solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Status\n",
    "\n",
    "While it's not perfect yet, I'm proud of what I was able to figure out and make work. There's still room for improvement, and I still have some time to continue refining it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll continue working on optimizing and enhancing the project over the next 2 weeks.\n"

    "## Application to Programming Language Learning\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Learn a new programming language (PYTHON!)\n",
    "2. Find a book that's easy to get into and complete in a weekend (around 200 pages)?\n",
