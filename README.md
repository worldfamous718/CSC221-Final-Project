## 📌 Project Overview

This project was completed as the **final assignment for CSC 221 (Advanced Python)**.  
It demonstrates the use of Python for **web scraping, data parsing, and visualization** using a real-world data source.

The goal was to scrape structured data from a public website, store it in a CSV file, and generate visual insights from the collected dataset.

## 📊 Data Output

The web scraping script extracts relevant information for each Python book listed on the No Starch Press website, including:

- Title
- Author(s)
- Price
- Publication details (where available)

The collected data is exported to a **CSV file**, which is then used to generate visualizations showing trends in the dataset.

## ▶️ How to Run (Quick Start)

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in **Jupyter Notebook**
3. Run the web scraping notebook to generate the CSV file
4. Run the visualization notebook to produce graphs from the CSV data

> This project was developed and tested using Anaconda and Jupyter Notebooks.

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

This project reflects how Python is used in practice to:
- collect data from live sources
- transform raw data into structured formats
- derive insights through visualization

These skills are directly transferable to roles involving **data analysis, automation, cybersecurity research, and scripting**.
